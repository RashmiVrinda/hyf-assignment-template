Part 2: Reflection

1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.
Learned 1: Advanced CSS Flex/Ratio Control: I learned the effectiveness of using specific flex ratios (e.g., flex: 1 and flex: 3) to precisely control the distribution of space between columns in a display: flex container. This was the key to ensuring the content was visually dominant over the image.

 Learned 2: Isolating and Correcting File Path Issues: I reinforced how crucial it is to get file names and paths exactly right. We debugged an issue where the CSS wasn't loading, which was solved by confirming the correct file name was styles.css (plural) and that the relative path was correct.

Learned 3: Prioritizing Semantic CSS Refactoring: I reinforced the importance of immediately refactoring code (removing Tailwind classes from HTML and placing all styling in styles.css) when transitioning from rapid prototyping to final, clean code. This ensures maintenance is easier and correctly separates HTML structure from CSS presentation.

2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilotâ€™s suggestions to suit your needs?

The most significant correction involved CSS class names and layout priority. Initially, the suggested CSS didn't align with my HTML structure and applied a balanced column ratio, making the portrait too dominant. I had to manually tweak the CSS to enforce a specific 1:3 column ratio to get the content balance right. Additionally, I corrected the CSS file path and name from the suggested singular style.css to the necessary plural styles.css to fix the loading error.

3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?

Using AI to generate code (e.g., "Write me a portfolio page") quickly produces a functional template, saving time on boilerplate. However, it often requires extensive correction and fine-tuning. Using it as an effective learning partner (e.g., "Why is my hero section off-center?" or "How can I make the content twice as wide as the image?") is more valuable. In this mode, the AI helps diagnose specific layout problems (like default browser margins) or suggests optimal CSS solutions, which deepens my understanding of core concepts.

4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.

Reduced Problem-Solving Resilience: Over-reliance prevents me from struggling through and solving complex bugs myself, which is crucial for building the essential developer skill of debugging and logical problem decomposition.

Lack of Conceptual Depth: If I only ask the AI to generate the code, I miss the underlying "why" (e.g., why flex ratios work the way they do). This leads to a surface-level understanding that collapses when faced with novel problems.
